# caesar_cipher_sinatra

A very basic sinatra application. Part of the sinatra curriculum on The Odin Project (theodinproject.com).

Ciphers one or more words using a specific number.

Not finished yet, I have to add the function to cipher(decode) back, but as the main focus of the project is to learn sinatra and I have already made a complete caesar cipher application I don't see it as urgent currently.
